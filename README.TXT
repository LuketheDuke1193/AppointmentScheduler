Hello! Thank you for taking the time to evaluate my project for C195.

My two languages are English and Spanish. You'll notice there is, in fact, a radio button choice for either language.
However, the language should automatically be set to your System's default locale. (See Lines ~90 and on of the
LoginScreenController class). The business hours are listed in UTC time.

My program currently has two users with login information here:
Username: test Password: test
Username: test2 Password: test2

The database is also in UTC time. Some columns were intentionally left blank per statements from the course chatter board
from instructors.

The buttons below the appointment tableview calendar for sorting by month, week and all gather the appointments for the
next 30 days, 7 days, and all appointments, respectively.

The time change function is based on the systems time zone.

Appointments that are scheduled back to back are considered to overlap. (i.e One ending at 10:00:00 and another
beginning at 10:00:00 would overlap.)

I used 4 instances of 3 different Lambda expressions. They can be found in the MainScreenController, the
LoginScreenController and the ConsultantTableController.

The log.txt file should be within the project folder.

Thanks again for taking the time to go over this.

Lucas Roberts
